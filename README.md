## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Frontend Developer** focused on building **scalable, high-performance, and user-centric web applications** using modern JavaScript frameworks and UI systems.

I specialize in **React and Next.js** with **TypeScript**, and I enjoy designing clean component architectures, reusable UI patterns, and efficient state management solutions. I pay strong attention to **code quality, performance, and developer experience**.

I have hands-on experience with modern styling and component systems such as **Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and MUI**, and I work comfortably with state management libraries like **Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and Jotai**. For APIs and validation, I use **tRPC and Zod** to ensure type safety and reliability across applications.

I’m continuously learning and improving, with a strong interest in **performance optimization, scalable frontend architecture, and clean UI/UX design**.
